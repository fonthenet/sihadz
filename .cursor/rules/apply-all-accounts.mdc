# Apply for All Accounts (Platform-Wide)

**"All accounts"** means: **old**, **new**, **future**, **pro**, and **patients**.

When the user says **"apply for all accounts"** or **"all accounts"**:

- **Time scope**: old (already signed up), new (just created), future (not yet created or opened)
- **User types**: patients + all pros (doctor, nurse, pharmacy, clinic, laboratory, ambulance)
- Use shared components, layouts, and constants—no per-account-type branches for styling/behavior
- Fix the source of truth once so all current and future users get it

## Scope

Patient dashboard, professional dashboards (all pro types), super-admin—everyone.

---

# Apply for Pro Only

When the user says **"apply for pro only"** or **"pro accounts only"**:

- Apply the change only to **professional dashboards**: doctor, nurse, pharmacy, clinic, laboratory, ambulance
- Do NOT change patient dashboard or super-admin
- Use `ProDashboardSidebar` or pro-specific components
- Old and new pro accounts get it; patients are unchanged
