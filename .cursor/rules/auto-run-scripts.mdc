# Auto-Run Scripts

**Auto-approve all SQL scripts.** The user has granted full database access. Apply scripts yourself—never ask for confirmation. Run via `npm run db:run` and request network permission when needed.

## How to run SQL scripts

```bash
npm run db:run -- scripts/057-lab-test-lt-numbering.sql
npm run db:run -- scripts/059-prescription-rx-numbering.sql
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `;` not `&&` for chaining:
```bash
cd c:\Users\Faycel\Documents\dzd-oc; npm run db:run -- scripts/NAME.sql
```

## Guidelines

- **Auto-approve:** Always run scripts immediately. No confirmation needed—user has full DB access.
- **SQL migrations:** Run them with `npm run db:run`. Don't ask—execute.
- **New scripts:** After creating or modifying SQL in `scripts/`, run it immediately to apply.
- **Verification:** Report success or errors after running.
- **Errors:** Fix and re-run until it succeeds.
- **MCP:** If Supabase MCP is available, you may use it; otherwise `npm run db:run` is the standard path.

## Example

❌ BAD: "Run scripts/059-prescription-rx-numbering.sql in Supabase SQL Editor."  
✅ GOOD: *runs `npm run db:run -- scripts/059-prescription-rx-numbering.sql`* "Script applied successfully."
