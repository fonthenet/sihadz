# Consistent Fixes Across All Profiles

When implementing fixes or features, ensure they apply to **all profiles** of the same type—not just one account. **All accounts** = old, new, future, pro, and patients.

## Professional Profiles

If a fix or feature applies to one pro profile, it must apply to **all pro profiles** when:
- It's a default setting or behavior
- It's a shared feature (availability, messaging, dashboard UI, etc.)
- It's a style or layout change
- It's a bug fix in shared components

## Patient Profiles

If a fix applies to one patient, it must apply to **all patients** (old and new) when:
- It's a messaging fix
- It's a style or UI change
- It's a settings change
- It's a default behavior

## Implementation

- **Database fixes:** Update ALL rows, not just one user's data
- **Code fixes:** Fix the shared component/logic, not a per-user workaround
- **Migrations:** Apply to existing data, not just new records
- **Defaults:** Set at the system/schema level, not per-account

## Example

❌ BAD: Fix message styling for user X only  
✅ GOOD: Fix message styling in the shared component so all users benefit

❌ BAD: Add default setting for new accounts only  
✅ GOOD: Migrate existing accounts + set default for new ones
