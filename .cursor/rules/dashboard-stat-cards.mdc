# Dashboard Stat Cards: Alternating Colors

## Rule

**All dashboard stat cards must use the shared alternating color palette** from `lib/dashboard-stat-colors.ts`. Use `getStatCardClasses(index)` and `getStatCardTextLight(index)` with index 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... to cycle through teal → cyan → emerald → violet → amber.

Applies to nurse, doctor, pharmacy, clinic, laboratory, ambulance, patient—all new and old accounts.

## Do Not

- Hardcode gradient classes (e.g. `from-teal-500 to-teal-600`) on stat cards
- Use different color schemes per dashboard—use the shared palette
